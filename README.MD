# Assignment

## Adding a new Amplication Plugin

### Task Overview

In this task, you will create a new [Amplication Plugin](https://docs.amplication.com/plugins/overview/) that adds new functionality to the code generated by Amplication.

In order to get started you should complete the following steps:
1. Follow our guide for [Getting started with a local development environment](https://github.com/amplication/amplication#development-environment-local)
2. Read the [docs for plugin development](https://docs.amplication.com/plugins/overview/) including the [Architecture](https://docs.amplication.com/plugins/plugin-architecture/) and [how to create your plugin](https://docs.amplication.com/plugins/how-to-create-plugin/)

After you've completed the above, make sure you can generate a basic application with Amplication (you can use the template entities available in the service creation wizard to get started quickly). Make sure to generate both REST APIs and GraphQL APIs.

Now pick one of the generated entities and look at the files generated by Amplication in the `base` folder. E.g. for the `User` entity look at `apps/my-service/src/user/base/`.
Observe that the Service (`*.service.base.ts` file) implements a `count` method, and that the GraphQL resolver (`*.resolver.base.ts` file) exposes this `count` method via GraphQL.

In contrast to the GraphQL resolver, observe that the REST API Controller (`*.controller.base.ts` file) does **not** expose the `count` method for the entity via REST.

### Your Task 
Your task is to create an Amplication Plugin, that adds the `count` functionality to the generated REST controllers, similar to how it gets exposed via the generated GraphQL resolvers.

You can use the [following method](https://docs.amplication.com/plugins/how-to-test-plugin/) to debug and test your Plugin locally during the development process.

Since we are open-source üíú you can get some inspiration from our [existing plugins repo](https://github.com/amplication/plugins)
  

### Task Expectations

- Write the code yourself
- Give credit in a dedicated file (e.g. `sources.md`) to sources of code you used from the Internet (make sure you understand every aspect of your submitted code)
- Add tests that proves it works as expected. Try to think of edge cases that require testing.
- Submitted code should include: the plugin you've created, and relevant tests

### Task submission

Students are expected to use the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) when working on their project. 

1. Creating a new branch
2. Making changes on the new branch( the given repository is template for plugin, so you can use it)
3. Creating a Pull Request to merge changes into main branch on or before the assignment deadline.
3. Using GitHub Discussions to ask any relevant questions regarding the project
